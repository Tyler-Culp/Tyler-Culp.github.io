        Below are a few of my more recent projects that I am particularly proud of. 
        If you want to browse the source code for any of my projects, they can all be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub here</a>.

        <h3>Pcap Tracker</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp/local_packet_tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Repo</a></p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a service that analyzes network traffic from different devices. 
            Initially inspired by a curiosity about smart home device traffic, it evolved into a tool that visualizes network activity for any device of interest.  
            Users can upload a PCAP (packet capture) file and specify an IP or MAC address to analyze, then view visualizations of traffic volume over time, 
            communication partners, and geographic destinations.  
            The application is live at <a href="https://pcaptracker.site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pcaptracker.site</a>, 
            or users can run it locally via Docker by cloning the GitHub repo.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed custom Python scripts using the Scapy library for packet analysis</li>
            <li>Utilized multithreading to optimize PCAP processing, ensuring efficient large file analysis</li>
            <li>Created interactive data visualizations using D3.js to display network traffic insights</li>
            <li>Built a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on a Linux cloud server</li>
            <li>Implemented a Flask middleware, served with Gunicorn, to handle requests between the frontend and backend</li>
            <li>Configured Apache as a reverse proxy to Flask, ensuring secure and scalable deployment</li>
            <li>Packaged the application with Docker for simplified deployment and local execution</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Jit (Java Git)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp/Java_Git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Repo</a></p>
        <p>
            A recreation of the Git version control software built from scratch in Java using Gradle for consistent and quick builds.
            I developed this project to explore how Git operates internally and interacts with the file system.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented in Java and built using Gradle for efficient and reliable builds</li>
            <li>Supports basic Git operations: status, add, commit, log, checkout</li>
            <li>Tested with JUnit and Mockito to ensure functionality</li>
            <li>Implemented a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on code pushed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Few-Shot ML Pneumonia Classifier</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp/Few-Shot-Pneumonia-ML-Model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Repo</a></p>
        <p>
            A major challenge in medical machine learning is acquiring large, high-quality datasets for training models.
            To address this, my team and I developed a few-shot learning model that requires significantly fewer images to train while maintaining high accuracy.
            Our model needed only ~50 images to achieve ~88% accuracy, compared to conventional models requiring thousands.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized common Python ML libraries including NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas</li>
            <li>Built a ResNet-based ML model optimized for low-data scenarios</li>
            <li>Achieved 98% of the performance of a standard model trained on ~3000 images</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Compass Android App</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp/Social-Compass-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Repo</a></p>
        <p>
            Developed an Android application in a team of six using Agile development practices.
            The app allows users to add friends via unique codes and track their real-time locations on a dynamic compass UI.
            Friend locations update continuously as they move throughout the day, with data synchronized via a cloud-hosted AWS SimpleDB server.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built with Java in Android Studio, utilizing Gradle for consistent builds</li>
            <li>Implemented real-time location tracking with live updates from a cloud-hosted database</li>
            <li>Designed a compass-based UI that dynamically rotates based on user movement</li>
            <li>Added zoom functionality to adjust the view based on friend proximity</li>
            <li>Ensured continuous background location updates for seamless tracking</li>
            <li>Implemented a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on code pushed</li>
        </ul>
