            Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Tyler and I’m a graduate computer science student with a strong interest in software development, security, and networking. 
            I love designing and building software solutions—from conceptualizing an idea to executing it optimally. 
            Tackling complex problems and optimizing solutions is what drives me.
            Beyond development, I enjoy exploring software from both defensive and offensive perspectives. 
            In my free time, I participate in red team activities like Hack The Box and various CTF challenges to deepen my security skills.

    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        In my free time I like to try and be active to balance out all the sitting I normally do. 
        Usually that means making time to go to the gym or taking the dogs for a walk around the neighborhood.
        I also really enjoy the outdoors, often going out for walks on the river banks near my house and spending quite a bit of time at the beach in San Diego.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some other things I like to do in my freetime are play video games (of course) and read books.
        My taste in video games has skewed towards the single person story driven games (my favorite of which being Hollow Knight).
        For books I usually am either reading some kind of fiction or a text book on a topic I'm interested in.
        Recently I just finished my second read through of <i>Dune</i> and am now reading <i>The Count of Monte Christo</i> and a book on Operating Systems.
